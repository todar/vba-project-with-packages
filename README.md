# 🚀 VBA Project With Packages

This is a project template for VBA Excel Apps. It lives at https://github.com/todar/VBA-Project-With-Packages.

To create a new project based on this template using git

```bash
git clone --depth=1 --branch=master https://github.com/todar/vba-project project-name
rm -rf ./.git
```

**Note that you will need to have [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed for this.**

## 🏃‍♂️ Usage

After creating a new project, use `git init` to start tracking your new project.

By default, after every save this will export a copy of all code into `src` and `tests` directories. This can be version controled using git.

Also, all references will be saved to the `references.txt` file.

## ⚠ Warning

 Importing code is still experimental!!! Please use this function with caution as it overwrites code and erases modules.
